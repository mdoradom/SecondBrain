This tag is used for saving **useful resources**, **articles**, and **links** that I find interesting or relevant for future reference. It includes external materials like tutorials, research papers, blog posts, and web pages, curated through the [Obsidian Web Clipper](https://obsidian.md/clipper), an official plugin that allows me to easily capture content directly from my browser into my Obsidian vault. These bookmarks serve as quick access to important or inspiring sources that may be referenced later.

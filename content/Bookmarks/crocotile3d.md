Create [[tags/3D]] models and environments with tiles. Typically tiles are used from 2d tilemaps to construct flat scenes, but Crocotile 3d adds another dimension. Watch the example videos to see what is possible.

- Draw and Edit modes to easily add/remove/edit tiles in 3d space.
- Perspective & Orthographic projection.
- Export to .obj/.gltf/.glb/.dae and use your creations in other programs or in your game development.
- Import .fbx/.gltf/.glb/.dae/.obj files from other applications and continue working with them in Crocotile.
- Place blocks like minecraft!
- Modify UVs on tiles, adjust tileset sizes.
- Paint editor tools for creating/modifying your tilesets.
- Rotate, flip, mirror, reverse faces, verts and UVs.
- Vertex colors.
- Lights and Shadows.
- Animated Tiles / UVs
- Animation and Movie rendering.
- (NEW) Skinning and Rigging (Bones and Vertex Weights).
- Split/cut tiles.
- Copy/paste tiles.
